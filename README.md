# OnTheMap
Udacity iOS nanodegree "iOS Networking" final class project.
"On The Map" is a networking app that allows the user (a udacity studeny, or udacion) to post their location, and
also allows the udacion to post an interesting link (web, linkedIn, etc). The app provides a means to log in,
a mapView with pins showing udacion locations, a list of udacions who are currently "on the map" in a tableView,
and also a means to post/update their location.

The app uses two API's:
  Udacity API for posting a new session, getting user public info, and deleting an existin session.
  Parse API for posting/updating a location.
